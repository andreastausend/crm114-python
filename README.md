[CRM-114][1] Python Module
==========================

This project is a Python module to interact with [The CRM-114 Discriminator][2],
which handles learning and classification of text streams. While written and
used primarily in spam classification, CRM-114 handles text streams of logs,
data, etc. just as well with recorded accuracy rates exceeding 99.9%. A wide
variety of methods can be used with CRM-114, namely regular expressions,
approximate regular expressions, Hidden Markov Model, Orthogonal Sparse Bigrams
(OSB), winnow, general correlation, K-Nearest-Neighbor, and bit entropy.

Originally crafted by [Sam Deane][3] of [Elegant Chaos][4] and [Born Sleepy][5],
with ongoing improvements and maintenance by [Brian Cline][6].
